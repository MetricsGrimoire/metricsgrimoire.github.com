        <h2>Welcome to Metrics Grimoire</h2>

<p>Metrics Grimoire (usually pronounced in the French way)  aims at providing a full set of tools to mine your favourite open source projects (included those hosted at GitHub!).
This project was born in the Libresoft research group at University Rey Juan Carlos. After several years of work, a small community started to grow. Even later, a spin-off appeared, named Bitergia. In the meanwhile the old-named libresoft-tools were moved to a more neutral place where everyone is more than welcome to participate: Metrics Grimoire.</p>
